I'm **Sat Nguyen**, a software developer and project manager with over **8 years of experience** in **R&D and technology application development**.

I’m passionate about building **modern**, **scalable**, and **user-friendly** cross-platform software solutions. During my university years, I published a research project on an **IoT-based environmental monitoring system** for shrimp farms, integrating sensors and embedded technology.

Currently, I’m working as a **Project Manager** at a tech company, where I:
