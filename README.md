## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm **Sat Nguyen**, a software developer and project manager with over **8 years of experience** in **R&D and technology application development**.

I’m passionate about building **modern**, **scalable**, and **user-friendly** cross-platform software solutions. During my university years, I published a research project on an **IoT-based environmental monitoring system** for shrimp farms, integrating sensors and embedded technology.

Currently, I’m working as a **Project Manager** at a tech company, where I:
- Coordinate frontend, backend, mobile, and DevOps teams.
- Ensure delivery quality from concept to production.
- Facilitate communication between technical teams and stakeholders.

🎯 I'm looking for a new collaborative environment where I can grow further as a **Project Manager or Team Lead**, contribute practical value to impactful projects, and continue advancing my software development expertise.
